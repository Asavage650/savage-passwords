# Password Generator Page

## I added the JavaScript needed for this page to funtion properly. This process helped me understand how javascript and WEB APIS read and interpret the code that I input, it also helped me see how javascript is constructed. The password generator is designed to create and display a random password that consists of letters, numbers, and special characters and is between 8 to 128 characters long. A user can then use whatever password is created for most any websites or for personal use!
